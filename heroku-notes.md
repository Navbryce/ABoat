Heroku
- Create a *requirements.txt* file in the ABoat directory not the ABoatScraping directory **make sure it has the right dependencies**
- Update config file (*shipSettings.json* for scraper and *config.json* for angular)
- Have to REBUILD angular project AFTER the config file has been updated because the config file at the time of the build is built into the project
- Install Heroku repo: `> heroku plugins:install heroku-repo`
- Reset repo: `heroku repo:reset`
- Delete the `.git`
- `git init` (reinitialize)
- `heroku git:remote -a heroku`
- Delete logs from .gitignore
- Create `Logs` directory and `ships-route` subdirectory
- Create `ship-creation-log.log` inside `ships-route`
- Add, commit, and push changes
- Make sure log files exist
- Check the file system using "heroku run bash" to make sure the heroku git repository matches the heroku-combined branch
